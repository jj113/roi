# Group_triangulation

main.R : main function to carry out the computation for feature extraction over triangulation

ancillary.R : functions that are sourced into the main function

train_data : synthetic dataset for training the model

test_data : synthetic dataset for testing the model prediction performance

Brain.Tr2.rda : coordinates of triangles used to set up the simulation study

Brain.V2.rda : vertices of the triangles

Z1 : expanded grid for the for the rectangluar box containing the object with irregular boundary
